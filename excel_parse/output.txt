To disable this warning, you can either:
        - Avoid using `tokenizers` before the fork if possible
        - Explicitly set the environment variable TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=(true | false)

Based on the information provided, the total amount in the Revenue sheet is 25,000 THB. This can be calculated by summing up the values in the "amount" column: 5,000 + 1,200 + 4,500 + 800 + 6,000 + 1,500 + 7,000 = 25,000 THB.
